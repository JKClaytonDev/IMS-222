</h1>
Omni Marketing Cincinnati brings worldwide innovation to retail and shopper marketing. The entire spectrum of companies building the retail marketing ecosystem - retailers, technology vendors, payment processors, mobile developers, data providers, advertisers, agencies, and investors will come together for a unique, one-day event focusing on the online to offline dynamic and closing the transaction loop at retail.
